### **2. Goals and Objectives**
#### **Goals:**
1. Develop a high-performance RESTful API for managing tutors and courses.
2. Ensure scalability and maintainability by following best practices in Rust development.
3. Create a simple and intuitive experience for tutors to offer courses and students to find them.

#### **Objectives:**
- Implement a robust modular architecture using Actix Web.
- Use PostgreSQL for secure and scalable data storage.
- Provide essential features like tutor registration, course management, and advanced search options.

### **3. Target Audience**
1. **Tutors:**
    - Individuals and organizations looking to share knowledge through online courses.
2. **Students:**
    - Learners of various demographics seeking to upskill or learn new subjects.

### **4. Features and Functionalities**
#### **Core Features:**
1. **Tutor Management:**
    - Register tutors with detailed profiles (name, expertise, contact information).
    - Update tutor details as needed.

2. **Course Management:**
    - Add, update, and delete courses with detailed metadata (title, description, category, and duration).
    - Link courses to specific tutors.

3. **Student Interaction:**
    - Allow students to browse, filter, and search for courses by various criteria (e.g., tutor, category, title).
    - Provide detailed course descriptions for students to make informed decisions.

4. **General:**
    - Include a health-check endpoint to ensure API reliability and monitoring.

#### **API Endpoints:**
- **POST /tutors:** Register a new tutor.
- **GET /tutors/{id}:** Retrieve a tutor by ID.
- **POST /courses:** Create a new course.
- **GET /courses:** List all available courses.
- **GET /courses/{id}:** Retrieve detailed course information by ID.
- **GET /courses/search:** Search courses by title, category, or tutor.

### **5. User Stories**
1. **As a tutor**, I want to easily create and manage my courses so that they are accessible to students.
2. **As a student**, I want to search for courses that match my interests and needs.
3. **As an admin**, I want to monitor the health and performance of the API to ensure consistent uptime.

### **6. Constraints**
1. The backend must be implemented using Rust with the Actix Web framework.
2. PostgreSQL will serve as the primary database for course and tutor information.
3. The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users in its initial release.

---

### **7. Success Metrics**
1. API response times should remain below 200ms for 95% of requests.
2. The platform should support 1000 API requests per second without performance degradation.
3. Achieve 85% or higher test coverage for core functionality.

---

### **8. Risks and Assumptions**
#### **Risks:**
- High initial learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Rust and Actix Web.
- Potential scalability challenges with database queries if not properly optimized.

#### **Assumptions:**
- Tutors will provide accurate and complete information about their courses.
- Students will use stable internet connections to access the platform.
